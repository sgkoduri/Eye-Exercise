# Eye-Exercise
This creates a webpage with two eyes that follows the movement of your mouse. The eyes are synchronized so they move in the same direction to match the mouse. In this project, the mouse movement event is used to update the position of the ‘eye’ element. 

#Roadmap
Add more details to the eye
Create more events that the eye reacts too (i.e. blink when clicked)
