# Eye-Exercise
This creates a webpage with two eyes that follows the movement of your mouse. The eyes are synchronized so they move in the same direction to match the mouse. In this project, the mouse movement event is used to update the position of the ‘eye’ element through manipulating the DOM. 

# How to Run this Project
Download the files
Open index.html in a browser
Move mouse to triggere eye movement

# Roadmap
Add more details to the eye
Create more events that the eye reacts too (i.e. blink when clicked)
